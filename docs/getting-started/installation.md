# Installation

Guithium can be downloaded from Modrinth at [https://modrinth.com/project/guithium/](https://modrinth.com/project/guithium/).

It is a single jar that can run on either the Fabric client or the Paper server.

## Players

To install just drop the jar into your Fabric client's `mods` directory, or use your launcher's ability to install from Modrinth if it supports it.

{: .important }
You will also need to install the Fabric API jar the same way. If you have used mods before, chances are you already have this installed.

{: .note }
NeoForge and other mod loaders are not supported at this time. There are no current plans to support them in the future.

## Server Admins

To install just drop the har into your Paper server's `plugins` directory. That's it.

{: .note }
Spigot and other server platforms are not supported at this time. There are no current plans to support them in the future.
